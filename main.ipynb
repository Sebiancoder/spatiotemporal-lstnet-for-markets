In other words, should we normalize data and then split the time series in to features and labels, or split first and then only normalize features. From past work, ~~I have seen better Mean Average Percent Error (MAPE) by doing the former, but intuition says it shouldn't matter.~~ From some reading, I have learned that normalizing all data, and not just the features, is a form of train-test contamination, as it allows some information from the test set to be encoded in the train set. Only features should be normalized. \n",
